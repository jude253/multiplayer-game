# Overview

This subdirectory aims to have a better structure for the client and
server game code so that events can be sent back and forth from client
to server and the server/clients can update the games state accordingly,
staying in sync well.

In general, this version tries to make better use of object oriented
code and example pygame code to make the problem simpler to comprehend.
